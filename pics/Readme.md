Hello! Thank you for being interested in the /r/pics CSS contest!

There isn't much to it, but there are a few things that we should make clear:

* All functions of the site must be accessible and usable, easily identified, and easy for a user to use/identify

* Stick to tradition reddit layout. Userbar in the top right, sidebar off to the right, posts justified to the left, etc..

* Avoid animations

* Any sprites you use must be yours to use. Optain permission if they are not yours.

---

You *can* delete code! You *can* delete assets, if you need. There are some exceptions:

* All user flairs must be unchanged

* Line 860 and beyond should be untouched

Anything else is fair game. Note that both the above can be changed, but only if changing its design. The function must remain.

---

Any questions, comments, or concerns can be sent to /u/allthefoxes on reddit. See the post on reddit for some more information

**Please have your stylesheet submitted by January 31st, 2015**
